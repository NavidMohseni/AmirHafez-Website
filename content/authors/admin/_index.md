title: Seyed Amir Hafez Jokar Naraghi

Amirhafez is in love with CAAKE. Also, He is from Naragh, which is considered as the most civilized city in the world! (Although, Naraghies consider themselves as an autonomous country!). Seyed comes from a religious family and prays ten times a day as he learned this way of living from his master of life: <a href="https://hawzah.net/fa/Note/View/53279/%D9%86%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%BA%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D9%86%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%82%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87">Mula Ahmad Naraghi</a>. Furthermore, he is awesome in any game you may name, like Mafia or Football, to name but a few. However, the only thing Uncle Shelby doesn't know is about snakebites! So he has to go to visit <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/ilar.jam/">physicians </a> regularly to cure those deep wounds.
